# Neural Network Model Report

## Overview
This project leverages knowledge of machine learning and neural network principles to develop a binary classification model aimed at predicting the likelihood of success for applicants funded by **Alphabet Soup**, a nonprofit foundation. Alphabet Soup seeks an effective tool to identify the most promising applicants for funding based on their potential for success.

The analysis is based on a provided dataset, which contains information on over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset is stored in CSV format and includes various features relevant to the applicants.

## Data Processing
### Target Variable
- **Is_Successful**: This is the target variable, indicating whether the organization was successful after receiving funding.

### Feature Variables
The features used to train the model include:
- **Organization**
- **Ask_AMT**
- **Income_Amt**
- **Special_Considerations**
- **Status**
- **Classification**
- **Use_case**
- **Affiliation**
- **Application_Type**

### Variables to Exclude
The following variables should be excluded from input data as they are neither targets nor features:
- **EIN**
- **Name**
- **Use_Case**

## Model Development
### Model Architecture
- The initial model contained **97 neurons** in total.
- The second iteration of the model expanded to **224 neurons**.

### Model Performance
Despite these efforts, the model did not reach the desired performance level. Various strategies were attempted to optimize model accuracy, such as removing additional columns, increasing the number of neurons, and adding more layers.

## Results Summary
- **Model Accuracy**: 72.94% — a promising starting point for real-world applications but below the target of 75% or higher.
- **Loss**: 0.5559 — indicative of the overall error in predictions. While this value is reasonable, further optimization is needed to reduce it.

## Recommendations for Improvement
To enhance model performance, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize all features (e.g., using `StandardScaler`).
   - **Handle Missing Data**: Ensure that missing values are appropriately managed.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model’s learning capabilities.

### 2. **Ensemble Methods**
   - **Train Multiple Models**: Build multiple models with varying architectures and combine their predictions using ensemble techniques such as voting or averaging to boost overall accuracy.

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Utilize these metrics alongside accuracy to get a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.
